    Deliberative Dimension 
    & \texttt{v2xdl\_delib}
    & The deliberative component is higher when decisions are judgetd to be reached via deliberation characterized by a commitment to the common good, and not by emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochialism, or coercion. V-Dem measures the extent to which political elites justify their behavior by adverting to the public good, respecting counter-arguments, and the extent to which they consult other elites.\\ \hline  	
    
    Participatory Dimension
    & \texttt{v2x\_partip}
    & The participatory component is higher in countries which actively involve citizens in the political process. It measures the extent to which citizens have direct influence on policy decisions, through civil society, through direct democratic initiatives, and through subnational bodies.\\ \hline  
    
    Egalitarian Dimension
    & \texttt{v2x\_egal}
    & The egalitarian component is higher in countries which reduce the barriers that ordinary people face, when trying to exercise their formal rights. It is thus higher in countries where resources and rights are judged to be distributed equally across social groups, and where this allocation meets their basic needs. \\ \hline
