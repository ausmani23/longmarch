###fig_prefests
This figure presents the estimated long-run impact of a standard deviation increase in long-run mobilization on each of the main dependent variables in this paper. These estimates come from our preferred models, which include country-level random effects, regional and year fixed effects, dummies for the identity of a country's colonial power, and a bevy of controls displayed in Table \ref{tab_regtablr}. These estimates are identical to those presented in that Table, except that these have been standardized to facilitated interpretation of effect size. The error bars denote 95\% confidence intervals -- as discussed in Section \ref{app_lrms} of the Appendix, these CI's are calculated by simulation rather than analytically.
###fig_robustnessmain
This figure illustrates that our main estimates are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. This figure lists each of these robustness checks on the y-axis (for a full description of each specification, see the main text), and each of our main dependent variables on the x-axis. Unless otherwise suggested, each model is restricted to the same sample we use for our preferred specification. 
###tab_descriptive
This table presents the average, standard deviation, and average within-country standard deviation ('Within SD') of each variable included in our preferred specifications. By average within-country standard deviation we refer to the average of the within-country standard deviations in our sample (i.e. $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} SD_{i}}{N} $, where $SD_i$ is the standard deviation of a given variable in country $i$).
###tab_regtablr
This table reports long-run estimates from our preferred models. As discussed in the main text and in Section \ref{app_lrms} of the Appendix, the inclusion of a lag of the dependent variable on the right-hand side of our models permits calculation of the cumulative (and not just immediate) impact of a change in a given independent variable. Note that each of these estimates is standardized. It represents the impact of a SD-sized change in the independent variable on the relevant variable, also in standard deviations. Each column of this table presents estimates from models with a different dependent variable. Our favored specification thus includes each of the controls listed along the left-hand side of the table, as well as a variety of other controls indicated in `Model Info' (dummies for the identity of a country's colonial ruler, country-level random effects, region-level fixed effects, and year-level fixed effects). As explained in Section \ref{app_lrms} of the Appendix, due to the difficulty of calculating standard errors analytically, we report 95\% confidence intervals (and we use 90\%, 95\% and 99\% confidence intervals to compute the corresponding level of statistical significance).
###tab_regtabsr
This table reports short-run estimates from our preferred models. In models which include lags of the dependent variable, short-run estimates are not useful gauges of practical significance (i.e. effect size), and the statistical significance of any given estimate is typically identifcal to the statistical significance of the corresponding long-run estimate. For these reasons, we relegate these estimates to the Appendix. Because standard errors for short-run estimates are easy to compute analytically, we report these rather than the confidence intervals reported in \ref{tab_regtablr}.
###fig_robustness
This figure illustrates results from the various robustness checks. The x-axis denotes the robustness check (i.e. model) being considered. Table \ref{tab_robmods} translates. The y-axis denotes the covariate in question. (Where the tile is empty, this is because the covariate in question is not a part of the model in question.) As we discuss in more detail in Section \ref{app_robustness}, the consistency of our estimates across specifications affirms our confidence in the main inference in this paper: that the length of unarmed mobilization prior to transition predicts subsequent democratic deepening.
###fig_robustnessall
V-Dem decomposes four of the five main dimensions into subdimensional indices (`Mid-Level Democracy Indices'). This figure illustrates the estimated, long-run impact of `Unarmed Mobilization' on each of the main dependent variables as well as these submdimensional indices (and on the Polity2 index and a combined Polity2/Freedom House index). Outcomes are on the y-axis, and models are on the x-axis (denoted by letters, which correspond to the key in Table \ref{tab_robmods}). We do not discuss most of these estimates in the main text, but we include them here in case readers are interested in identifying subdimensional patterns. 
###fig_allcfs
This figure illustrates the predicted gains made after after transition (averaged across all democratic spells) under each of three scenarios: (1) Mass Mobilization (`Unarmed Mobilization' set to 4.3 years); (2) As Observed ('Unarmed Mobilization' left as observed); (3) Quiescence ('Unarmed Mobilization) set to 0 years. (Section \ref{app_predictions} of the Appendix describes our methods and the results in more detail). The y-axis denotes the average gains made in each scenario (in standard deviations of the dependent variable), and the x-axis denotes the number of years that have elapsed since transition. Each line plots the average trajectory under a different scenario. 
###fig_mobgains
This figure illustrates the estimated aggregate impact of mobilization on democratic deepening, as measured by the predicted gap in democratic gains made in a world in which all transitions unfolded amidst mobilizations of 4.0 years, which is the $90^{th}$ percentile value of all post-1950 pro-democratic mobilizations, and a world in which all transitions unfolded amidst quiescence. Section \ref{app_predictions} of the Appendix describes our methods and the results in more detail. The y-axis denotes the average difference in gains made under these two scenarios (in standard deviations of the dependent variable), and the x-axis denotes the number of years that have elapsed since transition. The solid line plots the average size of gains made across all spells that have survived a given number of years since transition, while the shaded area spans a 95\% confidence interval for this average.
###fig_progress
This figure presents two different estimates of the share of democratic deepening after 10 years which can be attributed to mobilization. The left-hand panel plots `Losses from Quiescence', which are calculated as the progress made under quiescence as a percentage of the progress made in the observed world, subtracted from 100. This can be interpreted as the percentage of democratic deepening forgone in a world without mobilization. The right-hand panel plots `Gains from Mobilization', which are calculated as the additional progress made in a world of mass mobilization as a percentage of observed progress, subtracting 100. This can be interpreted as the additional deepening that would have been witnessed in a world in which all democracies were detonated by mass mobilization. The points denote our estimate, and the error-bars a corresponding 95\% confidence interval.
